Hi! My name is Loc. I'm 22 as of 2021. I'm currently a student in ITMO university.

I'm also do doing competitive programming as my hobby, and some what proudly call myself a 
competitive programmer. `darkkcyan` is my nickname on various sites,
and most of them are competitive programming sites like [codeforces].

I like watching anime, and sometimes playing game.

That's might be it for this About page, and this page might be changed very soon.
