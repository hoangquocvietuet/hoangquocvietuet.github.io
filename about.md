Hello, I'm Viet, a student at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET-VNU). As you may know, I also go by the nickname [Lihwy](https://codeforces.com/profile/Lihwy). My hobbies include playing football and cooking. As an introvert, I tend to keep things brief, so that's all for my introduction. ðŸ¥º

Welcome to my blog! Here, you'll find nothing but my experiences in Competitive Programming, my Learning Progress in Development, and a few other snippets from my life. Enjoy your stay!
